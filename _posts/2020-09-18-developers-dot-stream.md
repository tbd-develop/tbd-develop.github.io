Since realizing that there were more than just game streams on Twitch, I've always been in search of great streamers doing what I do. I joined the Livecoders team in late 2019 and it is one of the best groups of people I've ever been a part of. But, if you're not a Livecoder, or eligible to join the Livecoders team just yet, where do you get found?

There are other lists out there;

[Awesome Developer Streams](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams)
[Belly.io](https://belly.io)

These both present curated lists of developers streaming. 

I have more ideas for what I want to do with my list, but it has to start somewhere. So, for now I give you

[Developers//Stream](http://developers.stream)

The Science & Technology development community on Twitch is growing, and there are more people streaming by the day.  Self promotion shouldn't be shameful, but it's pretty intimidating when you're a small streamer. I want to do my part in opening up that community, allowing others to find streams that do development and helping with that promotion. 

If you're interested in being added to the list, then simply submit an issue and I'll get you in there shortly.
